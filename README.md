# Quantum_Memory_Entangled_Computer
Quantum Memory Entanglement Computing (QMEC) explores quantum entanglement for memory storage, retrieval, and processing. By unifying memory and computation, QMEC enhances speed, reduces power consumption, and enables parallel quantum logic operations. This repo includes research, simulations, and experimental models.
