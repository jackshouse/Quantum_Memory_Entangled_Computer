Quantum Memory Entanglement Computing (QMEC) Project

Overview
Quantum Memory Entanglement Computing (QMEC) is a cutting-edge computational model that integrates quantum entanglement with memory and processing. 
This project aims to explore and develop a functional proof-of-concept for QMEC, demonstrating how entangled quantum states can be used for memory storage, retrieval, and computational processes. 
The long-term goal is to revolutionize computational speed and efficiency while reducing power consumption.

Project Goals
- Develop a quantum computing framework where memory and processing are unified.
- Implement quantum entanglement for data storage and retrieval.
- Establish a functional quantum logic system within an entangled memory architecture.
- Compare QMEC performance to classical and quantum computers in terms of speed, power consumption, and efficiency.

Features
- Quantum Entangled Memory Storage: Binary data stored and retrieved via entangled qubits.
- Instantaneous Data Access: No physical data transfer needed, reducing latency.
- Low Power Consumption: Memory and computation in the same system eliminate energy-intensive data transmission.
- Parallel Processing: Simultaneous execution of logical operations on entangled qubits.
